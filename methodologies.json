The SDLC aims to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within time and cost estimates, and is maintainable and scalable. It provides a well-defined framework for all the activities that take place during the software development process.",

While the exact names can vary, they generally follow this sequence:<br><br><h4>1. Planning & Requirement Analysis</h4><p>This is the most important phase. Business requirements are gathered and analyzed by senior members of the team. This stage involves understanding the problem, defining the project goals, and creating a project plan.</p><h4>2. Design</h4><p>The system and software design is prepared from the requirement specifications. This helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining the overall system architecture.</p><h4>3. Implementation/Coding</h4><p>On receiving system design documents, the work is divided into modules/units and actual coding is started. This is the longest phase of the SDLC.</p><h4>4. Testing</h4><p>After the code is developed, it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the product is actually solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements phase. During this phase, all types of functional testing like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing are done.</p><h4>5. Deployment</h4><p>Once the software is certified and no bugs or errors are stated, then it is deployed to the production environment.</p><h4>6. Maintenance</h4><p>Once the system is deployed, and customers start using the developed system, issues may come up and need to be fixed from time to time. This process where the care is taken for the developed product is known as maintenance.</p>",

Design</h4><p>The requirement specifications from the first phase are studied in this phase and the system design is prepared. This system design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining the overall system architecture.</p><h4>3. Implementation</h4><p>With inputs from the system design, the system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is referred to as Unit Testing.</p><h4>4. Verification (Testing)</h4><p>All the units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post-integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.</p><h4>5. Maintenance</h4><p>This is the final phase. There are some issues which come up in the client environment. To fix those issues, patches are released. Also to enhance the product, some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment.</p>",

They manage the Product Backlog, ensuring it is visible, transparent, and clear to all. They decide <em>what</em> needs to be built.</li><li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> A servant-leader for the Scrum Team. They help everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values. They coach the team in self-organization and help remove impediments (blockers) to the team's progress.</li><li><strong>Development Team:</strong> A self-organizing, cross-functional group of professionals who do the actual work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of 'Done' product at the end of each Sprint.</li></ul><h4>Events</h4><ul><li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> A meeting where the entire Scrum Team collaborates to define the work to be performed in the upcoming Sprint and how it will be achieved.</li><li><strong>Daily Scrum:</strong> A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities, discuss progress, and plan for the next 24 hours. Often called a 'stand-up'.</li><li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. The team demonstrates what they built to stakeholders.</li><li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> An opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself (people, relationships, process, tools) and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.</li></ul><h4>Artifacts</h4><ul><li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> An ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements.</li><li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> The set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment.</li><li><strong>Increment:</strong> The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.
